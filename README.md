# AiMs-Raid-Suite

#### group frame
- adding an option for scaling (maybe)
- adding an option for highlightning tanks, dds and healers or even individual players
- maybe separating frames (one for tanks, dds and healers) and using the remaining space on the left side of the header bar to distinguish them from each other


#### possible bugs (not tested yet)
- EVENT_GROUP_MEMBER_CONNECTED_STATUS might reset current timers if someone had a disconnect, Logged off or is logging in again
- Tracking might not work in PvP because of changes where it was possible to track incoming damage while channeling a skill (e.g. lethal arrow)


#### menu settings
group frame:
- tracking tanks (+ small hightlight button)
- tracking healers (+ small hightlight button)
- tracking dds (+ small hightlight button)
- selecting synergies
- disable second synergy
